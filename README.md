# Quote Generator

Hello, this is my first project in attempt to finish 20 JavaScript projects in a month.
Kindly check it out on this [link](https://theodorusclarence.github.io/quote-generator/).

## Building Process
I am using forismatic API to grab the quotes, then append it to a proxy AllOrigins to prevent CORS Error(due to forismatic being public API).
